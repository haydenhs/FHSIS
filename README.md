# FHSIS
Fast Hyperspectral Image Sharpening using Learned Affine Transforms

This is part of my graduation thesis project. Here we present a fast HSI sharpening
(FHSIS) model for the super-resolution of a low spatial resolution
(LR) HSI with the help of an auxiliary high spatial resolution (HR)
RGB image. Different from the existing HSI and RGB image fusion
based super-resolution methods, which predict the HR HSI image
in an end-to-end manner, we directly predict the inverse spectral
response and map the RGB image back to the HSI space using
affine transforms.
