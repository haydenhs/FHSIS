<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p>
    Hyperspectral images (HSIs) contain rich spectral information and
    are an important data source for many visual applications. Compared
    with RGB images, the application of HSI is limited due to the
    tradeoff between the spatial and spectral resolution in hyperspectral
    imaging systems. In this paper, we present a fast HSI sharpening
    (FHSIS) model for the super-resolution of a low spatial resolution
    (LR) HSI with the help of an auxiliary high spatial resolution (HR)
    RGB image. Different from the existing HSI and RGB image fusion
    based super-resolution methods, which predict the HR HSI image
    in an end-to-end manner, we directly predict the inverse spectral
    response and map the RGB image back to the HSI space using
    affine transforms. Specifically, the proposed method tries to learn
    a coarse grid (with a set of spectral bases) from the input LR HSI
    and a HR weight map from the HR RGB image. Combining the
    spectral bases and the weight map in a grid upsampling module,
    we can generate a per-pixel affine transform for the target HR HSI
    and directly apply it to the HR RGB to obtain a super-resolved HR
    HSI. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our purposed
    method is comparable to state-of-the-art methods with much faster
    running speed.</p>
